			<h1>The Band</h1>
			<div>
				<p>Mental Shift is a Rockband from the Netherlands! Their sound has been described as similar to Skunk Anansie,
					Kate Bush, Placebo, The Gathering and Within Temptation. While alternative in its core, the different musical
					backgrounds of the musicians result in a mix of influences from pop, metal and indie.</p>
				<p>The songs are mostly mid tempo and are characterised by heavy riffs, high pitched vocals, accessible melodies
					with a solid base of drum and bass which leads to the very accessible, melodic, alternative rock of Mental Shift,
					sometimes rap or grunt.</p>
				<p>Mental Shift shows are lively, theatrical and filled with humor. The band celebrated their second anniversary in
					September 2018. The band has accomplished a lot in their first years and builds on this foundation to expand their
					activities.</p>
				<p>In summer 2018 their debut album ‘Emergence’ was recorded in the Netherlands at Rockinc. Recording and released
					on rock label ‘Snakebite Records’ in November 2018. The album was produced by most respected producer and musician
					Joss Mennen (Zinatra and Mennen).</p>
				<p>Mental Shift hits the stage regularly. A repertoire of over 30+ self written songs has been build which allows
					the band to play up to an evening filling performance when required.</p>
				<p>You can also listen to Mental Shift on any music streaming service worldwide like Spotify, TIDAL, 7Digital,
					Apple Music, Deezer, Google Play, Amazon etc.</p>
				<p>Mental Shift is: Daphne: all lyrics, song melodies, ad libs, choirs, raps. Hans: all guitars, arrangements, song
					themes, riffs, Aad: all bass and Michiel: all drums.</p>

				<h2>Line Up</h2>
				<h3>Daphne – Lead Vocals, Songwriter, Lyrics</h3>
				<img class="small-right" src="img/band/daphne.png">
				<p>Daphne started her singing career at an early age, joining The Academy Of Vocal Arts in The Hague at the age of
					8. This intensive vocal training allowed her to develop her voice and a solid understanding of music and singing
					in general. In releasing several albums and performing throughout Europe her passion for singing was awakened.</p>
				<p>Through her teens and twenties she enjoyed singing lessons in pop (Musical Academy Leiden) and classical singing
					(Het Phondament The Hague). She also took lessons with Floor Jansen (Nightwish) to develop a more powerful style
					and learn belting techniques. She has been writing songs and lyrics for over ten years which she performed in
					several bands. Very experienced in live gigs she performed dozens of times at festivals and pop stages.</p>
				<h3>Hans – Guitar, Backing Vocals</h3>
				<img class="small-left" src="img/band/hans.png">
				<p>Hans is playing the guitars in Mental Shift. He started playing classical guitar at the age of seven, inspired
					by the great Segovia, his father used to listen to. He taught Hans the basics of fingerpicking. Somewhat later,
					during highschool, Hans got inspired by Deep Purple’s Richie Blackmore, Jethro Tull’s Locomotive Breath, Uriah
					Heep’s Gipsy, Alice Cooper’s Billion Dollar Babies and Peter Frampton’s live guitar playing. Hans wanted to make
					such sounds too. He stopped classical guitar lessons and learned himself how to rock, by playing at least three
					hours a day. As a teenager he got his first 3 man band, creating their own rock songs and sound. Covering other
					ones songs just was not done these days. From that moment this band changed musical style, line up and had several
					band names every few years.</p>
				<p>After 25 years of changes, ups and downs, lots of gigs though, Hans finally quitted the scene and ended up
					toggling an acoustic guitar and rediscovered the classical guitar for a bit, while raising kids and stuff. From
					2010 Hans started up again, doing classical rock songs in several cover bands. Later on playing the modern
					blues-rock. He got inspired by guys like John Mayer and Joe Bonamassa. A challenge it was for sure, learned new
					guitar playing technics and he still likes playing this genre once in a while. But still it didn’t give him the
					ultimate satisfaction that he used to experience in his earlier days. Making new music, creating his own sounds on
					Daphne’s creations, that’s what really keeps him going.</p>
				<h3>Michiel – Drums </h3>
				<img class="small-right" src="img/band/michiel.png">
				<p>Michiel started playing drums when he was 15 years old. He learned playing the drums mainly autodidact and
					attended one year of education in jazz-feel drumming to improve his techniques for playing the style of drumming
					he likes best. His first inspiration came from drummers like Ian Paice, John Bonham, Steve Copeland and John
					Cogholan from very successful bands at that time. More recent through the large numbers of drum clinic video’s on
					YouTube he keeps on developing his drum skills. Together with Hans, who plays lead guitar, he played in a band for
					twenty years long with the same bass player rock feel music. They arranged their own compositions for most of the
					years. In the third life of this band they had a period of covering rock music hits from various legendary bands
					from the seventies and eighties. Additional to their steady band formation of the three men they had different
					guitarists singers, background vocalists and keyboard players to join them.</p>
				<p>In between this long period with the same band Michiel also played drums in various gospel bands, pop ensembles
					and musical orchestras. He likes to play different kinds of musical styles to enrich his musical experiences and
					skills. But the style he likes most is rock feel straight bold or massive symphonic.</p>
				<p>He is playing his Japanese manufactured Yamaha drum kit over the last 25 years of his drumming career. An
					excellent kit completed with Latin percussion accessories, chimes and a large cymbal line- up of Zildjan K dark
					series. From crash to splash, ride, crash ride, china and of course the hi-hat set. Although not playing drums
					full time like a professional, it is by far his most favourite habit to do in life.</p>
				<p>Playing in the band Mental Shift with their inspiring and overwhelming vocals of front woman Daphne is for him
					the ultimate experience in performing. He likes playing concerts and he is at his best on stage. Maybe sometimes
					so eager that he needs to be tamed, but never too much!</p>
